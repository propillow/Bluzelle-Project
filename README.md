# Bluzelle-File-Validator

A file validation web application to ensure the file that has been transferred from one location to another has the correct content and that no data has changed. This is done through cryptographicly hashing the file content into SHA-256 content and inserting it into bluzelle decentralized database. Then, we can verify that the file has the same content as before by checking the hash value inside the database.

### How to run application

- Open index.html file in a web browser
- Navigate through the UI and register the file
- Send the file through any file transfer protocol
- Check to see if the file contains the same content
